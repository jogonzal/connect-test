This project is deployed at: https://jorgeconnectplatform.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Wishlist

1. Query params for "current account" that refresh the page
2. Ability to test all connect elements
3. Move off of nextjs and into a simple parcel/nodejs setup
