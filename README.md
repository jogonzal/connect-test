This project is deployed at: https://jorgeconnectplatform.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Wishlist

1. Better errors when APIs fail (i.e. transmit stripe API error body and print it in client)
1. Add create subscription in customers page and integrate the subscription management page
1. Integrate customer portal
1. Add crypto onramp test integration
1. Localization (add react-intl, etc)
1. Make theming work without full page reload
